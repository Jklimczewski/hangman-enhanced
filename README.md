# :book: Hangman project

## :notebook: Description

I've made this project during my first year of studies on course "Web Application Security". That was the first time I learned the OAuth standard and implemented it, in this example with Keycloak.
### 🧰 Architecture
- a simple server written in JavaScript, Node.js and connected to MongoDB Database
- client written in JavaScript, React
- connected to Keycloak middleware, secured server endpoints and client routes
- usage of Dockerfiles and Docker-Compose to dockerize the App ☁️☁️
- self signed SSL certificates and Nginx reverse proxy

## :star: Main features
- user authorization with Keycloak run with Docker
- available wordsList filtering to test the server security and user roles
- Hangmann game! 🎮
